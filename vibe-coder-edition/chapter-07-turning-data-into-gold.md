# Chapter 7: Turning Data Into Gold 🍽️✨

## Your Infrastructure's Data Processing System

Remember how we talked about your infrastructure being like a living organism? Well, if that's true, then your data processing system is like its digestive system! 🍕➡️💪

**Think about it:**
- Your stomach doesn't just store food - it transforms it into energy
- Your infrastructure doesn't just store data - it transforms it into insights
- Both break down raw materials into useful stuff your body/business can use

In this chapter, we'll learn how to build a data processing system that:
- 📥 Collects data from everywhere (like gathering ingredients)
- 🔄 Transforms it into useful information (like cooking)
- 📊 Stores it for quick access (like meal prep)
- 🎯 Serves it up when you need it (like dinner time!)

**No PhD required!** We'll use simple analogies and your AI buddy to guide you through everything. 🤖

## 🎬 The Old Way vs The New Way

### The Old Way: The Restaurant That Closes for Inventory 🏪❌

Imagine a restaurant that has to close down every night to:
1. Count all the ingredients
2. Write down what sold
3. Calculate profits
4. Make tomorrow's menu

**Problems:**
- ❌ Restaurant closed = no sales = unhappy customers
- ❌ By morning, yesterday's data is already old
- ❌ Can't react to trends (like "wow, everyone wants tacos tonight!")
- ❌ Super slow and expensive

This is how old databases worked - they'd freeze everything to run reports! 😱

### The New Way: The Smart Kitchen 🏪✅

Now imagine a modern restaurant with:
- **Smart scales** that track ingredients in real-time
- **Digital orders** that flow instantly to the kitchen
- **Live dashboard** showing what's popular RIGHT NOW
- **Auto-ordering** when ingredients run low

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Never closes - always serving
- ✅ Real-time insights (taco Tuesday is trending!)
- ✅ Automatic reordering (never run out of guac)
- ✅ Predictions (prepare for lunch rush)

This is modern data processing! 🎉

**Visual Comparison:**

```
Old Way:
Day Time: [Serve customers] → Night: [CLOSED - Counting inventory]
                                       [Processing sales]
                                       [Making reports]
Next Day: [Use yesterday's old data]

New Way:
[Serve customers] ←→ [Process data in real-time]
        ↓                      ↓
  [Instant insights] ← [Live dashboards]
        ↓                      ↓
  [Smart decisions] ← [Automatic actions]

ALWAYS OPEN! Always learning! 🚀
```

## 🧩 The Three Building Blocks

### Building Block 1: The Conveyor Belt (Kafka) 🏭

**What is it?**
Kafka is like a super-smart conveyor belt in a factory. Events (things that happen) go on the belt, and different workers can grab what they need.

**Everyday Analogy:**

```
Think of airport baggage handling:

Your Bag (Event) → Conveyor Belt (Kafka) → Multiple destinations:
                                           - Security screening
                                           - X-ray machine
                                           - Your airline
                                           - Weight checker

Same bag, many purposes!
Same event, many consumers! 🎒✈️
```

**Cool Features:**

1. **Never Forgets:** Belt keeps running even if a worker takes a break
   ```
   Worker on vacation? No problem!
   When they come back, their bags are still there waiting! 🏖️
   ```

2. **Multiple Readers:** Ten workers can look at the same bag
   ```
   Security ✅ Customs ✅ Airline ✅ Weight Check ✅
   All reading the same data! 🔍
   ```

3. **Super Fast:** Millions of events per second
   ```
   Like a conveyor belt going at superhero speed! 🦸‍♀️💨
   ```

4. **Durable:** Keeps events for days/weeks
   ```
   Like video replay - you can go back and watch what happened! 📹
   ```

**Real-World Example:**

```
🛒 User clicks "Buy Now"
    ↓
📋 Order Event goes on Kafka belt:
    {
      "user": "Alice",
      "item": "Blue Widget",
      "price": 29.99,
      "time": "2024-01-15 14:30:00"
    }
    ↓
Multiple teams grab it:
    → 💳 Payment Team: Charge card
    → 📦 Shipping Team: Prepare box
    → 📊 Analytics Team: Update dashboard
    → 🎯 Marketing Team: Recommend similar items
    → 📧 Email Team: Send confirmation

Same event, 5 different actions! ⚡
```

### Building Block 2: The Assembly Line (Stream Processing) 🔧

**What is it?**
Stream processing watches the conveyor belt and does things with events *as they happen* - no waiting!

**Everyday Analogy:**

```
Think of a car wash:

Dirty Car enters → [Rinse] → [Soap] → [Scrub] → [Rinse] → [Dry] → Clean Car exits
                      ↓        ↓        ↓         ↓        ↓
                   Step 1    Step 2   Step 3    Step 4   Step 5

Each station processes the car as it passes through!
No waiting for all cars to arrive first! 🚗💦✨
```

**What Can You Do?**

1. **Filter:** Only keep important stuff
   ```
   🛍️ All purchases → Filter → 💰 Only purchases over $100
   (Like a bouncer at a VIP club!)
   ```

2. **Transform:** Change the format
   ```
   "2024-01-15" → Transform → "January 15, 2024"
   (Like translating between languages! 🗣️)
   ```

3. **Enrich:** Add extra information
   ```
   User ID: 123 → Look up → Add name, email, location
   (Like adding toppings to a pizza! 🍕)
   ```

4. **Aggregate:** Combine many into one
   ```
   100 individual clicks → Count → "100 clicks in last minute"
   (Like counting votes! 🗳️)
   ```

5. **Window:** Group by time
   ```
   Count orders:
   - In last 5 minutes
   - In last hour
   - In last day

   (Like checking your watch at different times! ⌚)
   ```

**Real Example: Fraud Detection**

```
💳 Credit card swipe
    ↓
🔍 Stream Processor checks:
    ✓ Is location unusual? (NYC → Tokyo in 1 hour?)
    ✓ Is amount suspicious? ($0.01 then $9,999?)
    ✓ Too many attempts? (20 tries in 1 minute?)
    ↓
If suspicious → 🚨 BLOCK & ALERT
If normal → ✅ APPROVE

All happening in milliseconds! ⚡
```

### Building Block 3: The Scheduler (Airflow) 📅

**What is it?**
Airflow is like a super-organized assistant who makes sure tasks happen at the right time, in the right order.

**Everyday Analogy:**

```
Think of your morning routine:

6:00 AM → ⏰ Alarm goes off
6:05 AM → ☕ Start coffee maker
6:15 AM → 🚿 Shower (while coffee brews)
6:30 AM → 🍳 Make breakfast
6:45 AM → 🧥 Get dressed
7:00 AM → 🚗 Leave for work

Airflow makes sure things happen:
- At the right time ⏰
- In the right order 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣
- Even if something fails (coffee maker broken? skip that step!)
```

**What Can It Do?**

1. **Schedule Tasks:** Run things automatically
   ```
   Every day at 2 AM → Process yesterday's sales
   Every Monday → Send weekly report
   First of month → Calculate bonuses

   (Like setting recurring calendar events! 📆)
   ```

2. **Chain Tasks:** One after another
   ```
   Step 1: Download data ✅
   Step 2: Clean data ✅
   Step 3: Calculate stats ✅
   Step 4: Send report ✅

   If Step 1 fails → Don't do Step 2!
   (Like dominos - each needs the previous! 🎲)
   ```

3. **Parallel Tasks:** Do many things at once
   ```
         ┌─ Process US data ─┐
   Start ┼─ Process EU data ─┼─ Combine → Report
         └─ Process Asia data ┘

   (Like cooking multiple dishes at once! 🍳🥘🍜)
   ```

4. **Retry Failed Tasks:** Try again if something breaks
   ```
   Task failed? → Wait 5 minutes → Try again
   Still failed? → Wait 10 minutes → Try again
   Still failed? → Send alert to humans

   (Like pressing the elevator button again! 🛗)
   ```

**Real Example: Daily Sales Report**

```
Every night at 2 AM:

Step 1: 📥 Download orders from database
   ↓
Step 2: 🧹 Clean data (remove test orders, fix typos)
   ↓
Step 3: 📊 Calculate:
   - Total sales
   - Top products
   - Best customers
   ↓
Step 4: 📈 Make charts and graphs
   ↓
Step 5: 📧 Email report to boss

All automatic! No human needed! 🤖
```

                                  - Positive or negative?
                                  - Urgent or casual?
                                  - Trending topic?
                              ↓
                         Take action:
                         😊 Positive → Add to highlights
                         😠 Negative → Alert support team (URGENT!)
                         🔥 Trending → Notify marketing team
                         🎯 Campaign mention → Update metrics

Every hour, Airflow:
    - Generates sentiment report
    - Calculates campaign ROI
    - Identifies influencers

    ↓
Stream Processor:
    ✓ Brand mentioned
    ✓ Sentiment: POSITIVE
    ✓ Has photo
    ↓
Actions:
    - Add to "happy customer" collection
    - Send thank you message
    - Ask permission to share
    - Update sentiment dashboard

All in under 1 second! ⚡
```

### Use Case 3: IoT Device Monitoring 🏭

**The Challenge:**
You have 10,000 sensors in a factory. They send temperature, pressure, vibration data every second. You need to:
- Detect equipment failures before they happen
- Track efficiency
- Schedule maintenance
- Alert operators to problems

**The Solution:**

```
10,000 Sensors → Send data every second → Kafka
                                            ↓
                                    Stream Processor checks:
                                        - Temperature > 80°C? 🌡️
                                        - Vibration unusual? 📳
                                        - Pressure dropping? 📉
                                        - Pattern matching failure? 🔍
                                            ↓
                                    Immediate alerts:
                                        🚨 CRITICAL: Shut down machine!
                                        ⚠️  WARNING: Schedule maintenance
                                        ℹ️  INFO: Log for analysis

## 🏗️ Building Your Data Processing System

### Step 1: Set Up Kafka (The Conveyor Belt) 🏭

**What You Need:**
- Docker (your container buddy)
- Your AI helper (Claude/ChatGPT)
- 10 minutes of time

**Simple Setup:**

```yaml
# Save as docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  # Kafka's helper (needed for Kafka to work)
  zookeeper:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.5.0
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"

  # Kafka itself (the conveyor belt!)
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.5.0
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092

  # Web UI (so you can see what's happening!)
  kafka-ui:
    image: provectuslabs/kafka-ui:latest
    depends_on:
      - kafka
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      KAFKA_CLUSTERS_0_BOOTSTRAPSERVERS: kafka:9092
```

**Start It Up:**

```bash
# Start everything
docker-compose up -d

# Check it's working
docker-compose ps

# Open web UI in browser
# Go to: http://localhost:8080
```

**What You'll See:**

```
Kafka UI Dashboard:
    📊 Cluster: local
    ✅ Brokers: 1 online
    📁 Topics: (empty - we'll create some!)
    👥 Consumers: (none yet)

Perfect! Ready to send events! 🎉
```

### Step 2: Send Your First Event 📤

**Ask Your AI Buddy:**

```
You: "I have Kafka running. How do I send a simple event?
     I want to send an order event when someone buys something."

AI: "Great! Here's a simple Python script to send events to Kafka..."
```

**Simple Python Script:**

```python
# install first: pip install kafka-python
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to Kafka
producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)

# Create an order event
order = {
    'order_id': 'ORD-12345',
    'customer': 'Alice',
    'item': 'Blue Widget',
    'price': 29.99,
    'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
}

# Send it!
producer.send('orders', value=order)
producer.flush()

print('✅ Order sent to Kafka!')
print(f'📦 Order: {order}')
```

**Run it:**

```bash
python send_order.py

# Output:
✅ Order sent to Kafka!
📦 Order: {'order_id': 'ORD-12345', 'customer': 'Alice', ...}
```

**Check Kafka UI:**

```
Go to http://localhost:8080
→ Topics
→ orders
→ Messages

You'll see your order! 🎉
```

### Step 3: Read Events 📥

**Simple Python Script to Read:**

```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
import json

# Connect to Kafka
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'orders',
    bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],
    value_deserializer=lambda m: json.loads(m.decode('utf-8')),
    group_id='my-first-consumer'
)

print('👀 Watching for orders...')

# Read and print each order
for message in consumer:
    order = message.value
    print(f'\n📦 New order received!')
    print(f'   Order ID: {order["order_id"]}')
    print(f'   Customer: {order["customer"]}')
    print(f'   Item: {order["item"]}')
    print(f'   Price: ${order["price"]}')
```

**Run it in another terminal:**

```bash
python read_orders.py

# Output:
👀 Watching for orders...

📦 New order received!
   Order ID: ORD-12345
   Customer: Alice
   Item: Blue Widget
   Price: $29.99
```

**Cool Trick:** Run the reader first, then send events - you'll see them appear instantly! ⚡

### Step 4: Set Up Airflow (The Scheduler) 📅

**What You Need:**
- Docker (still using it!)
- A folder for your workflows
- Your AI buddy

**Simple Setup:**

```yaml
# Add to docker-compose.yml
  airflow:
    image: apache/airflow:2.7.1
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
    environment:
      AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR: LocalExecutor
      AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN: sqlite:////opt/airflow/airflow.db
    volumes:
      - ./airflow/dags:/opt/airflow/dags
      - ./airflow/logs:/opt/airflow/logs
    command: standalone
```

**Create Your First Workflow:**

```python
# Save as: airflow/dags/daily_report.py
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def say_hello():
    print('👋 Hello! Running daily report!')
    print('📊 Calculating yesterday\'s sales...')
    # Your actual logic would go here
    print('✅ Report complete!')

# Define when to run
dag = DAG(
    'daily_report',
    description='Generates daily sales report',
    schedule='0 8 * * *',  # Every day at 8 AM
    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    catchup=False
)

# Define the task
task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='generate_report',
    python_callable=say_hello,
    dag=dag
)
```

**Access Airflow:**

```
1. Go to: http://localhost:8081
2. Login: airflow / airflow
3. You'll see your "daily_report" workflow!
4. Click the ▶️ button to run it manually
```

**What You'll See:**

```
Airflow Dashboard:
    📋 DAG: daily_report
    📅 Schedule: Daily at 8 AM
    ✅ Last Run: Success
    ⏱️  Duration: 2.3 seconds
    📊 Task: generate_report [Success]
```

### Step 5: Put It All Together 🎯

**Complete Flow:**

```
1. Event Happens:
   👤 Customer buys widget
        ↓
   📤 Send to Kafka (orders topic)

2. Stream Processor:
   👀 Watching Kafka
        ↓
   ✅ Validate order
        ↓
   📊 Update real-time dashboard
        ↓
   💰 If high-value → Alert sales team

3. Airflow (Scheduled):
   🕐 Every night at 2 AM
        ↓
   📥 Read all day's orders from Kafka
        ↓
   📊 Calculate statistics
        ↓
   📧 Email report to boss
```

**Ask Your AI Buddy to Connect Them:**

```
You: "I have Kafka running with orders. I have Airflow running.
     How do I make Airflow read from Kafka and generate a report?"

AI: "Great question! Here's how to connect them..."
```

**Simple Airflow DAG That Reads Kafka:**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def read_daily_orders(**context):
    """Read yesterday's orders from Kafka"""
    consumer = KafkaConsumer(
        'orders',
        bootstrap_servers=['kafka:9092'],
        value_deserializer=lambda m: json.loads(m.decode('utf-8')),
        auto_offset_reset='earliest'
    )

    orders = []
    for message in consumer:
        orders.append(message.value)
        if len(orders) >= 100:  # Read first 100
            break

    total_revenue = sum(order['price'] for order in orders)

    print(f'📊 Daily Report:')
    print(f'   Orders: {len(orders)}')
    print(f'   Revenue: ${total_revenue:.2f}')

    return {'orders': len(orders), 'revenue': total_revenue}

dag = DAG(
    'daily_kafka_report',
    schedule='0 8 * * *',  # 8 AM daily
    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    catchup=False
)

task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='generate_report',
    python_callable=read_daily_orders,
    dag=dag
)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Start Small, Think Big 🌱

**Don't Do This:**
```
❌ "Let me process ALL our data in real-time
    with 10 stream processors and 5 databases!"
```

**Do This:**
```
✅ Day 1: Send one event to Kafka
✅ Day 2: Read that event
✅ Day 3: Count events
✅ Day 4: Add dashboard
✅ Week 2: Scale up
```

**Why?** Walking before running prevents face-plants! 🏃‍♂️💨😵

### 2. Monitor Everything 👀

**Set Up Alerts:**

```
⚠️  Alert if:
    - Kafka lag > 1000 messages ("Houston, we're falling behind!")
    - Stream processor crashes ("Worker down!")
    - Airflow job fails ("Task exploded!")
    - Database connection lost ("Where'd our data go?")
```

**Dashboard Checks:**
```
Every morning, check:
    ✅ All systems green?
    ✅ No error spikes?
    ✅ Performance normal?
    ✅ Data quality good?
```

### 3. Test with Fake Data First 🎭

**Before Going Live:**

```python
# Generate fake orders
def create_fake_orders(count):
    for i in range(count):
        order = {
            'order_id': f'TEST-{i}',
            'customer': f'Test Customer {i}',
            'price': random.uniform(10, 100),
            'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
        producer.send('orders', value=order)

# Send 1000 test orders
create_fake_orders(1000)

# Check:
# ✅ Did they all arrive?
# ✅ Did processing work?
# ✅ Are metrics correct?
```

**Why?** Better to break things with fake data than real customers! 😅

### 4. Keep It Simple 🎯

**Prefer This:**

```
Simple Pipeline:
    App → Kafka → One Consumer → Database → Dashboard

Pros:
    ✅ Easy to understand
    ✅ Easy to debug
    ✅ Easy to fix
    ✅ Fast to build
```

**Over This:**

```
Complex Pipeline:
    App → API Gateway → Message Queue → Kafka →
    Stream Processor → Redis → Another Stream Processor →
    Data Lake → ETL → Warehouse → BI Tool → Dashboard

Cons:
    ❌ Hard to understand
    ❌ Hard to debug ("Where did my data go?!")
    ❌ Many points of failure
    ❌ Months to build
```

**Rule of Thumb:** Can you draw it on a napkin? If not, simplify! 📝

### 5. Document Your Data 📚

**Keep a Data Dictionary:**

```yaml
Event: order_created

Fields:
  order_id:
    type: string
    example: "ORD-12345"
    required: yes

  customer_id:
    type: string
    example: "USER-789"
    required: yes

  price:
    type: number
    example: 29.99
    required: yes
    validation: must be > 0

  timestamp:
    type: datetime
    example: "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z"
    required: yes

Producers: ["checkout-service", "mobile-app"]
Consumers: ["analytics-service", "email-service", "shipping-service"]
```

**Why?** Future you will thank present you! 🙏

### 6. Handle Failures Gracefully 🛡️

**What Can Go Wrong:**

```
Problems You'll Face:
    💥 Kafka goes down
    💥 Database connection lost
    💥 Invalid data arrives
    💥 Disk full
    💥 Memory exhausted
    💥 Network timeout
```

**How to Handle:**

```python
def process_message(message):
    try:
        # Validate first
        if not is_valid(message):
            send_to_error_queue(message)
            return

        # Try to process
        result = do_processing(message)

        # Save result
        save_to_database(result)

    except DatabaseError as e:
        # Database down? Retry later
        retry_queue.add(message)
        alert("Database connection issue!")

    except ValidationError as e:
        # Bad data? Log and skip
        log_error(f"Invalid data: {e}")
        send_to_error_queue(message)

    except Exception as e:
        # Unknown error? Alert humans!
        alert(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        send_to_error_queue(message)
```

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ Expect failures
- ✅ Have a plan for each type
- ✅ Don't lose data
- ✅ Alert humans when needed

### 7. Version Your Events 🏷️

**Why?** Your events will evolve over time!

```python
# Version 1 (Old)
order_v1 = {
    'order_id': 'ORD-123',
    'price': 29.99
}

# Version 2 (New - added tax field)
order_v2 = {
    'version': 2,  # <-- Version number!
    'order_id': 'ORD-123',
    'price': 29.99,
    'tax': 2.40  # New field
}

# Your processor handles both:
def process_order(order):
    version = order.get('version', 1)  # Default to v1

    if version == 1:
        # Old format
        total = order['price']
    elif version == 2:
        # New format
        total = order['price'] + order['tax']

    return total
```

**Benefit:** Old and new systems work together! 🤝

## 🎮 Interactive Quiz

Test your knowledge! Click to reveal answers.

### Question 1: What is Kafka? 🤔

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>

**Answer:** Kafka is like a super-smart conveyor belt that:
- Carries events (messages) from producers to consumers
- Keeps events for days/weeks (doesn't forget!)
- Lets multiple consumers read the same events
- Handles millions of messages per second

**Real-World Analogy:** Airport baggage handling system - your bag goes on a belt, and multiple workers (security, customs, airline) can check it!

**When to Use:** When you need reliable, fast, scalable message passing between services.
</details>

### Question 2: Batch vs Stream Processing? 🤔

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>

**Batch Processing:**
- Process data in chunks (once per hour, day, week)
- Like doing laundry - wait until you have a full load
- **Example:** Daily sales report at 2 AM

**Stream Processing:**
- Process data immediately as it arrives
- Like washing dishes right after dinner
- **Example:** Fraud detection on credit card swipes

**When to Use Each:**
- **Batch:** Historical analysis, reports, ML training
- **Stream:** Real-time alerts, live dashboards, instant decisions

**Can Use Both!** That's called Lambda Architecture 🎯
</details>

### Question 3: Why Use Airflow? 🤔

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>

**Answer:** Airflow is your automatic task scheduler that:

**Solves These Problems:**
- ❌ "I forgot to run the daily report!"
- ❌ "Step 2 ran before Step 1 finished!"
- ❌ "The task failed and I didn't notice for 3 days!"

**How It Helps:**
- ✅ Runs tasks on schedule (daily, weekly, hourly)
- ✅ Chains tasks in correct order
- ✅ Retries failed tasks automatically
- ✅ Sends alerts when things break
- ✅ Shows you a pretty UI of what's happening

**Real-World Analogy:** A super-organized assistant who makes sure your morning routine happens in the right order, even if the coffee maker breaks!

## 📖 Quick Reference Card

### Kafka Quick Commands

```bash
# Start Kafka
docker-compose up -d

# Create topic
docker exec kafka kafka-topics \
    --create --topic my-topic \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

# List topics
docker exec kafka kafka-topics \
    --list \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

# Send message (console)
docker exec -it kafka kafka-console-producer \
    --topic my-topic \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

# Read messages (console)
docker exec -it kafka kafka-console-consumer \
    --topic my-topic \
    --from-beginning \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

### Python Kafka Quick Start

```python
# Producer
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)

producer.send('my-topic', value={'hello': 'world'})
producer.flush()

# Consumer
from kafka import KafkaConsumer

consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'my-topic',
    bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],
    value_deserializer=lambda m: json.loads(m.decode('utf-8'))
)

for message in consumer:
    print(message.value)
```

### Airflow Quick Reference

```python
# Basic DAG
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def my_function():
    print('Hello!')

dag = DAG(
    'my_dag',
    schedule='0 8 * * *',  # 8 AM daily
    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1)
)

task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='my_task',
    python_callable=my_function,
    dag=dag
)

# Schedule Options:
# '0 8 * * *'     - Daily at 8 AM
# '0 * * * *'     - Every hour
# '*/15 * * * *'  - Every 15 minutes
# '@daily'        - Once a day at midnight
# '@hourly'       - Every hour
```

### Common Patterns

```python
# Pattern 1: Filter Events
def filter_high_value(event):
    if event['price'] > 100:
        process_vip_order(event)

# Pattern 2: Transform Events
def add_timestamp(event):
    event['processed_at'] = datetime.now()
    return event

# Pattern 3: Aggregate Events
def count_by_category(events):
    counts = {}
    for event in events:
        category = event['category']
        counts[category] = counts.get(category, 0) + 1
    return counts

# Pattern 4: Enrich Events
def add_customer_info(event):
    customer = get_customer(event['customer_id'])
    event['customer_name'] = customer['name']
    event['customer_email'] = customer['email']
    return event
```

## 🤝 Getting Help

### When You're Stuck 😵

**Ask Your AI Buddy:**

```
You: "My Kafka consumer isn't receiving messages.
     I can see them in Kafka UI but my Python script
     shows nothing. What could be wrong?"

AI: "Let me help! This usually happens because of a few common reasons..."
```

**Common Issues:**

```
Problem: "Nothing happens when I run my consumer"
Solution: Check if you're reading from the right topic!

Problem: "Messages arrive out of order"
Solution: That's normal in Kafka! Use timestamps to sort.

Problem: "Airflow task won't run"
Solution: Check the scheduler is running, check task dependencies.

Problem: "Too much data, system is slow"
Solution: Add more consumers, use batch processing.
```
