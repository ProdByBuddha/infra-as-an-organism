ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF AI COLLABORATION

This work was created in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic), an AI
assistant. The curation, vision, systems thinking, and creative direction are
entirely human. The AI served as a collaborator in generating code examples,
structuring content, and expanding on concepts.

This collaboration model is celebrated and disclosed transparently as part of
the book's philosophy: "AI doesn't replace human creativity—it reveals it."
