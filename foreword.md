# Foreword: From Survival to Systems Thinking

## The Day Everything Changed

July 2024. I was staring at my bank account, watching the numbers that represented my survival dwindle to almost nothing. A music deal I thought would save me had just fallen through—not because the music wasn't good, but because I had trusted the wrong person. Again.

I had spent years as a mix engineer, crafting sounds for independent artists, pouring my heart into every track. But that day, on the brink of homelessness, something crystallized in my mind: **I could trust code more than I could trust people.**

This realization didn't come from nowhere. I grew up in Benton Harbor, Michigan, attending Creative Arts Academy and the Gifted & Talented program—an education that shaped my neuroplasticity in ways I'm still discovering. I was dual-enrolled at Coloma High School and the Berrien County Mathematics and Science Center at Andrews University, exposed to both creative and analytical thinking from an early age. I went on to study Multimedia Arts and Technology at Western Michigan University before dropping out my sophomore year, following a path that I thought made sense at the time.

Then, on Halloween 2022, I came to Los Angeles for what was supposed to be a weekend party. I never left. Sometimes the most important decisions we make look like impulses—flying across the country for a party, staying when you planned to leave. But looking back, I see it was my intuition guiding me toward something I couldn't yet articulate. Los Angeles became the place where my transformation would happen.

But it was that moment in July 2024, broke and desperate in LA, when everything I'd learned suddenly converged.

## The 15-Month Transformation

That same October 2022, right around the time I arrived in Los Angeles, **Ken Thomas**—a seasoned developer—introduced me to the Transformers architecture. I had been familiar with ChatGPT since its public release, but I hadn't yet understood its potential to change not just how we work, but *who* could work. The city I'd stumbled into and the technology I'd just been introduced to would both prove essential to what came next.

After the incident, I made a decision: I would learn software development. Not casually. Not slowly. But with the intensity of someone who needed to rebuild their entire life.

I started with a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Simple. Achievable. Proof that I could make a computer do what I wanted. Then I recreated iPhone's Weather app, which introduced me to APIs—the connections between systems that make the modern internet work. But it was when I moved to back-end infrastructure, building authentication systems and object storage, that the light bulb went off.

**This was the foundation.** The infrastructure that powers Netflix. Uber. Every application that serves millions. And I had just built a piece of it.

I isolated myself to my IDE for months. Applications that will never see the light of day became my classroom. And something extraordinary happened: I started achieving what multiple language models told me were accomplishments worth six and seven figures in value—in days, sometimes hours.

But here's what they couldn't quantify: I had found my calling.

## The Sixth Sense I Never Knew I Had

Looking back, I realize I've always had a sixth sense for systems thinking and design. It was there in childhood, hidden beneath layers of survival mindset. When you grow up fighting to exist, you don't always recognize your gifts because you're too busy using them to survive.

But systems thinking is more than a skill—it's a way of seeing connections others miss. It's understanding that everything is part of something larger. That a problem in one place creates ripples everywhere. That solutions require thinking not just about the immediate fix, but about the entire organism.

This book exists because I finally understood that my gift wasn't about me. It was about what I could create for others.

## Why This Book Had to Exist

During that same period of transformation, I traveled from Los Angeles to attend San Francisco Tech Week. I sat in the nuclear fusion summit and watched as brilliant minds discussed the future of energy. And I thought about Benton Harbor. About communities like the one I grew up in that bear the environmental cost of progress they don't always benefit from.

I'm aware of the harm that AI data centers are causing to communities that look like the one I grew up in. The power consumption. The resource extraction. The concentration of wealth and opportunity in places that already have both.

**This book is my answer to that inequality.**

Not the complete answer—I'm not naive enough to think one book solves systemic problems. But it's a start. Because the more people who understand infrastructure, the more the playing field levels. The more voices in the room when decisions get made. The more developers who look like me, who grew up where I grew up, who understand the real cost of technology.

When more people can build, more people can challenge. When more people understand systems, more people can design better ones.

## Two Editions, One Mission

You're holding (or reading) something unusual: a book with two parallel editions. The Technical Edition, filled with production-ready code and deep architectural patterns. The Vibe Coder Edition, accessible to anyone who wants to understand but might not have a computer science background.

This structure isn't arbitrary. It's intentional. Because I believe that **technical developers and vibe coders are branches of the same tree.**

The gatekeeping in tech has to end. The idea that only certain people with certain backgrounds can understand "real" engineering is a lie that serves power structures, not progress. I've watched language models become so advanced they're actually reliable. I've used them to create this book—not to replace my thinking, but to amplify it.

The curation is human. The vision is human. The understanding of systems is human. But the tools we have now? They make it possible for someone who was broke in July to write a comprehensive infrastructure book by October.

If that doesn't prove that the old barriers are falling, I don't know what does.

## The Vision: Preschoolers to Elders

I see a world where a preschooler can articulate what they want to build and create it. Where elders who have spent lifetimes understanding community problems can translate that wisdom into solutions. Where your background, your formal education, your zip code don't determine whether you can be a builder.

This isn't utopian fantasy. The technology exists now. What's missing is the bridge—the understanding that makes these tools accessible. That's what this book aims to be.

Infrastructure as an organism. Not as abstract computer science, but as a living system that grows, adapts, protects itself, and serves those who depend on it. Whether you're reading the technical edition and implementing production Kubernetes clusters, or reading the vibe coder edition and finally understanding what your engineering team means by "the CDN," you're learning the same fundamental truth:

**Systems serve life. And you can design them.**

## What I Learned in the Fire

Survival mindset taught me resilience. But it also limited my perception of what I could achieve. When you're focused on making it to tomorrow, you don't always see that you could be building the future.

The betrayal that almost left me homeless was also the fire that forged this book. Not because suffering is noble—it's not. But because sometimes the moment when everything falls apart is also the moment when you finally see clearly.

I saw that I could trust code. That I could learn faster than I believed possible. That the tools existed to amplify human creativity beyond anything previous generations could imagine. And that someone had to write the book that connected these possibilities to real people.

So I did.

## A Note on AI and Human Creativity

Let me be direct: this book would not exist without AI assistance. Language models helped generate code examples, explain concepts, and structure information. I'm not hiding that. I'm celebrating it.

Because here's the truth they don't always tell you: **AI doesn't replace human creativity. It reveals it.**

Every chapter in this book came from my understanding of systems. Every metaphor connecting infrastructure to biology came from my sixth sense for how things connect. Every decision about what to include and how to explain it came from my experience learning this material at breakneck speed.

The AI was my collaborator, not my replacement. My very advanced, very capable pair programmer who never got tired and could generate code in any language I needed.

This is the future of creation. And if we do it right, it's a future where more people create, not fewer.

## Tech Giants and Market Forces

There's an AI bubble building. Something has to give. The current centralization of AI compute in massive data centers isn't sustainable—not environmentally, not economically, not ethically.

I believe much of this technology can and should be consolidated to on-device processing. I understand the role data centers play in critical AI and machine learning functions—the ability to get responses in seconds rather than minutes matters. But we need to be honest about the cost and creative about alternatives.

Nuclear fusion. Distributed computing. Edge processing. Solar-powered data centers. Carbon-neutral cloud infrastructure. These aren't just technical problems. They're justice problems.

And I believe that books like this one—that level the playing field, that unify technical developers and vibe coders—create pressure on tech giants to behave more fairly. When more people understand how the infrastructure works, more people can demand it work better. For everyone.

## Gratitude: The People Who Made This Possible

No one builds alone. No one transforms alone. This book exists because of a web of support, belief, and opportunity:

To **my family at-large**, who never stopped believing even when I stopped believing in myself.

To **Laurence McCarthy**, **Rondell Boston**, **Rene Turcios**, and **Trevor Martin**—your friendship and support kept me going when isolation felt overwhelming.

To **Nexus Network**, for seeing the potential before it was obvious.

To **Eternal Zion**, for providing not just collaboration but the space to ideate, to experiment, to fail, to learn, and to create resources like this book. Your trust in my rapid application of knowledge gave me room to prove what's possible.

To **Ken Thomas**, who introduced me to Transformers architecture in October 2022 and sparked the curiosity that became this journey.

To **every language model** that patiently answered my 3 AM questions, generated code examples, and helped me understand concepts I'd never been formally taught.

And to **you**, the reader, for picking up this book and giving me the chance to share what I've learned.

## How to Read This Book

If you're reading the **Technical Edition**: You'll find production-ready code in Go, TypeScript, Python, Rust, and other languages. Complete configurations for Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Terraform, and more. Deep dives into architectural patterns used by companies at massive scale. This edition assumes you want to implement, not just understand.

If you're reading the **Vibe Coder Edition**: You'll find emojis, everyday analogies, and explanations that assume zero prior knowledge. This edition treats you with respect—not by dumbing down concepts, but by finding clear ways to explain them. You don't need to be technical to understand infrastructure. You just need someone to explain it well.

If you're reading **both editions**: You'll see how the same concepts can be expressed for different audiences without losing depth. You'll understand how to communicate technical ideas to non-technical stakeholders. And you'll see, I hope, that these aren't two different types of knowledge—they're two different languages describing the same truth.

## The Promise

I can't promise this book will make you an expert overnight. I can't promise it will solve every infrastructure problem you face. I can't promise it will single-handedly level the tech industry's playing field.

But I can promise you this: **Every concept in this book is something I learned and applied over 15 transformative months.** If I could do it while fighting survival mode, while rebuilding my life from scratch, while learning to trust again—you can absolutely do it from wherever you are.

I promise to explain infrastructure not as magic, but as systems you can understand and build.

I promise to honor both the technical depth required for production systems and the accessible clarity required for learning.

I promise to show you that your background doesn't disqualify you. That your "non-traditional" path might actually be your greatest strength. That systems thinking is a gift some people develop through formal education and others develop through survival—and both are valid.

And I promise that by the end of this book, you'll understand infrastructure as an organism: living, breathing, growing, adapting, and fundamentally comprehensible.

## Begin

This book represents 15 months of intensive learning condensed into 10 chapters and two editions. It represents the belief that anyone can understand infrastructure if we just explain it clearly. It represents the conviction that leveling the playing field in tech is both possible and necessary.

But most of all, it represents hope. That someone from Benton Harbor, Michigan, who dropped out of college and nearly lost everything, could learn this material, apply it, and teach it to others.

If I can do this, imagine what's possible for you.

Let's begin.
